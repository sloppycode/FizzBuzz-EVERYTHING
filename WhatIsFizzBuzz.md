# What is FizzBuzz?
Fizz buzz is a group word game.
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".
In this repository, we do the same but with displaying the numbers in the terminal instead of saying them.

It goes like this:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
```
And so on
